                  <p class="card-text" style="text-align: left;">Currently, Siyi is working at Comcast as a Business Technology Consultant. She is looking for a position relates to Business Technology Analysis or Marketing Analysis.

                        Siyi graduated from Drexel University with a triple major in Management Information System, Legal Studies, and Early Education. As part of my extracurricular activities, Siyi was sitting vice president in the Management Information Systems Organization at LeBow Business School. In this position, Siyi had co-hosted workshops with project managers from companies such as SAP and Comcast and gained powerful understanding of how technology solutions support the goals of improved execution. Additionally, MIS coursework provides Siyi with in-depth knowledge of implementing the System Development Life Cycle under agile methodology and waterfall methodology. For example, she was consulting a startup company to improve their operational capacities via technological solutions. This project, in addition to other relevant endeavors, are detailed on Siyi's enclosed resume for your reference.
                        
                        Siyi enjoys challenging myself and looking deeper into problems to find appropriate solutions. An excellent example being that Siyi opened a pop-up womenâ€™s boutique in China during my sophomore year summer break. Siyi performed an independent marketing analysis on pricing strategies based on a specific customer segment, female college students, and launched small marketing campaigns to promote the boutique around local universities. This entrepreneurial experience within a customer-facing environment has equipped Siyi with strong interpersonal skills as well as cultivated Siyi's flexibility to respond to market trends as they emerge.
                        
                        The experience Siyi has in liaising between business and technical teams coupled with Siyi's diverse educational and personal background is a unique asset that makes her a highly compatible candidate for a Business Technology Analyst/ Consultant position.</p>
